</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Our blockchain, built with the Cosmos SDK on top of the consensus engine Tendermint, is an application-specific blockchain, as opposed to another popular type of virtual-machine blockchain with Ethereum as one the most prominent examples.
In a virtual-machine blockchain, the development revolves around building a decentralized application on top of an existing blockchain as a set of smart contracts. While smart contracts can be a good fit for use cases such as single-use applications (e.g., ICOs,) they often fall short for building complex decentralized platforms due to its limitations in terms of flexibility, sovereignty and performance.
On the other hand, application-specific blockchains offer a radically different development paradigm where a blockchain could be customized to operate a single application. Developers have all the freedom to make design decisions required for the application to run optimally. In addition, they can easily extend the application’s complexity with modules while not sacrificing sovereignty, security or performance.

At its core, a blockchain is a replicated deterministic state machine. A state machine is a computer science concept whereby a machine can have multiple states, but only one at any given time. In a blockchain context, the state machine is deterministic, i.e., if a node is started at a given state and replays the same sequence of transactions, it will always end up with the same final state. The Cosmos SDK gives developers maximum flexibility to define the state of their application, transaction types and state transition functions. To replicate the state machine implemented with Cosmos SDK over the network, we use Tendermint. Tendermint is an application-agnostic engine that is responsible for handling the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain. In practice, this means that Tendermint is responsible for propagating and ordering transaction bytes. The interface for message exchange between Tendermint and the application is called the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI.) It consists of a set of methods, each with a corresponding Request and Response message type.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The Cosmos SDK is the most advanced framework for building custom application-specific blockchains today. It is open source and designed to build blockchains out of composable modules with ease. At its core, the Cosmos SDK is a boilerplate implementation of the ABCI in Golang. It comes with a multistore to persist data and a router to handle transactions. An application built on top of the Cosmos SDK handles transactions from Tendermint via the DeliverTx method of the ABCI in four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decode transactions received from the Tendermint consensus engine</li>
<li>Extract messages from transactions and do basic sanity checks</li>
<li>Route each message to the appropriate module so that it can be processed</li>
<li>Commit state changes</li>
</ol>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Like other Comos SDK applications, our blockchain extends from the baseapp, which is the boilerplate implementation of a Cosmos SDK application. It comes with an implementation of the ABCI to handle the connection with the underlying consensus engine. The goal of baseapp is to provide a secure interface between the store and textensible state machine while defining as little about the state machine as possible.</p>

    </h5>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The Cosmos SDK provides a multistore for persisting state. The multistore allows developers to declare any number of KVStores. These KVStores only accept the []byte type as value and therefore any custom structure needs to be marshalled using a codec before being stored.
The Multistore abstraction is used to divide the state in distinct compartments, each managed by its own module.</p>

        <span>Modules</span>
    </h5>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Cosmos SDK applications are built by aggregating a collection of interoperable modules. Each module defines a subset of the state and contains its own message/transaction processor, while the Cosmos SDK is responsible for routing each message to its respective module.
Each module can be seen as a little state-machine. Developers need to define the subset of the state handled by the module, as well as custom message types that modify the state. In general, each module declares its own KVStore in the multistore to persist the subset of the state it defines and developers can leverage on 3rd party modules when building their own modules.</p>

    </h4>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Tendermint is software for securely and consistently replicating an application on many machines. By securely, it means Tendermint works even if up to ⅓ of machines fail in arbitrary ways. By consistently, it means that every non-faulty machine sees the same transaction log and computes the same state. Secure and consistent replication is a fundamental problem in distributed systems; it plays a critical role in the fault tolerance of a broad range of applications, from currencies, to elections, to infrastructure or orchestration, and beyond.
Tendermint consists of two chief technical components: a blockchain consensus engine and a generic application interface. The consensus engine, called Tendermint Core, ensures that the same transactions are recorded on every machine in the same order. The application interface, ABCI, enables the transactions to be processed in any programming language. Unlike other blockchain and consensus solutions, which come pre-packaged with built in state machines, developers can use Tendermint for BFT state machine replication of applications written in whatever programming language and development environment is right for them.</p>

<p>Tendermint implements a BFT consensus protocol as illustrated in the figure below.
<figure class="content-center">
    <img src="media/tendermint_consensus.png" alt="Tendermint's BFT consensus protocol (courtersy Tendermint Inc.)" />
    <figcaption class="caption">Tendermint&#x27;s BFT consensus protocol (courtersy Tendermint Inc.)</figcaption>
</figure>
Participants in the protocol are called validators; they take turns proposing blocks of transactions and voting on them. Blocks are committed in a chain, with one block at each height. A block may fail to be committed, in which case the protocol moves to the next round, and a new validator gets to propose a block for that height. Two stages of voting, namely pre-vote and pre-commit, are required to successfully commit a block. A block is committed when more than ⅔ of validators pre-commit for the same block in the same round.</p>
<p>Validators may fail to commit a block for a number of reasons; the current proposer may be offline, or the network may be slow. Tendermint allows them to establish that a validator should be skipped. Validators wait a small amount of time to receive a complete proposal block from the proposer before voting to move to the next round. This reliance on a timeout is what makes Tendermint a weakly synchronous protocol, rather than an asynchronous one. However, the rest of the protocol is asynchronous, and validators only make progress after hearing from more than two-thrids of the validator set. A simplifying element of Tendermint is that it uses the same mechanism to commit a block as it does to skip to the next round.</p>
<p>Assuming less than one-third of the validators are Byzantine, Tendermint guarantees that safety will never be violated - that is, validators will never commit conflicting blocks at the same height. To do this it introduces a few locking rules which modulate which paths can be followed in the flow diagram. Once a validator pre-commits a block, it is locked on that block. It must pre-vote for the block and can only unlock and pre-commit for a new block if there is a two-third consensus for that block in a later round.</p>
<doc-anchor-target id="stake">

        <span>Stake</span>
    </h5>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>In many systems, not all validators will have the same “weight” in the consensus protocol. Thus, we are not so much interested in one-third or two-thirds of the validators, but in those proportions of the total voting power, which may not be uniformly distributed across individual validators.</p>
<p>Since Tendermint can replicate arbitrary applications, it is possible to define a currency, and denominate the voting power in that currency. When voting power is denominated in a native currency, the system is often referred to as Proof-of-Stake. Validators can be forced, by logic in the application, to “bond” their currency holdings in a security deposit that can be destroyed if they’re found to misbehave in the consensus protocol. This adds an economic element to the security of the protocol, allowing one to quantify the cost of violating the assumption that less than one-third of voting power is Byzantine.</p>

This helps blockchain technology gradually become necessary and bring more practical applications.</p>
<p>Cryptstarter Blockchain is a platform that allows creating an open economy on its own structure. Unlike other projects that apply blockchain technology to a business model or solve a separate problem. Cryptstarter pursues the vision of creating an ecosystem with multiple economic models that work in sync.

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Cryptstarter is the first platform that creates a co-investment system that includes an investment relationship between three parties, Startups - Lead Investors - Retail investors. When the project is appraised and invested by the Main Investor from the beginning with a minimum rate of 20%, the Retail Investor can copy the strategy for a fee to mainstream investors. Thereby, startups can access community capital more easily and transparently.
The difference of Cryptstarter is that it allows Startups to issue Cryptocurrencies for their own project based on its Blockchain and managed by a fully-featured Smart contract like the Ethereum network. This allows investors to receive more direct economic benefits when the project&#x27;s Token increases in price and also gives Startups more flexibility in raising capital through the sale of their Project Token.</p>

<li><strong>Project appraiser</strong>: Lead investors are our project appraisers of Crypstarter. Not only giving professional opinions, but they are also the ones who make investment decisions with a minimum rate of 20%. That&#x27;s why any project they are invested in is more reliable than others.</li>
<li><strong>Project listing</strong>: Project appraised by Lead Investors will be featured on their portfolio page on our platform as well as especially recommended on the Crypstarter Platform. Retail investors can choose the project they want and join our special co-investment program.</li>
<li><strong>Co-investment Method</strong>: Leading investors share their investment strategies and reports on the projects they have chosen. Not everyone knows how to do Due Diligence on a project in a professional and precise way. This solution helps Retail Investors use their investment in a safer way.</li>
<li><strong>Fee Agreement</strong>: Projects that were shared and invested by Lead Investors will allow Retail Investors to participate in the co-investment model easily. In return, both can agree on a suitable fee. We provides a simple and transparent way through our blockchain technology.</li>
